            <p className="lead">Reboot builds upon Normalize, providing many HTML elements with somewhat opinionated styles using only element selectors. Additional styling is done only with classes. For example, we reboot some  styles for a simpler baseline and later provide .table, .table-bordered, and more.

Here are our guidelines and reasons for choosing what to override in Reboot:

Update some browser default values to use rems instead of ems for scalable component spacing.
Avoid margin-top. Vertical margins can collapse, yielding unexpected results. More importantly though, a single direction of margin is a simpler mental model.
For easier scaling across device sizes, block elements should use rems for margins.
Keep declarations of font-related properties to a minimum, using inherit whenever possible.</p>
